    "\n",
    "With concerns about environmental health and climate change on the rise, developing, improving, and establishing methods of clean energy generation is of increasing importance. One mode of renewable energy that has a lot of room for development is the generation of power through tidal energy. Currently, tidal energy is relatively undeveloped and has yet to be implemented in very many locations. One of the major challenges of tidal energy is identifying locations where it is both feasible and profitable to build the necessary facilities for power production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tidal power generation requires a consistent flow of water in order to function. Finding consistent flows sufficient to justify tidal power generation can be difficult in a highly variable medium, such as the ocean, where both flow intensity and direction are frequently changing and are affected by so many external forcings. Because the installation of tidal energy infrastructure is so costly and invasive, it is important to identify locations where it will be effective and useful. Models of ocean tides can be a valuable tool to select suitable locations for implementation of this challenging clean energy source. Coupling of ocean models and atmospheric models may also provide valuable insight on the significance of wind forcing on ocean tides and identify areas that would be either more or less suited to tidal energy generation because of it.\n",

    "## II. Model Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The model being profiled is the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) model that is developed by the NEMO Consortium which was established in 2008 and pulls together 5 European institutions (CMCC, CNRS, Mercator, Met-Office, NERC-NOC). The NEMO model is an open source, open access model comprised of three major components called NEMO-OCE, NEMO-SI3, and NEMO-TOP. The NEMO-OCE component models ocean thermodynamics and solves primitive equations; the NEMO-SI3 component models sea-ice thermodynamics, brine inclusions and subgrid-scale thickness variations; the NEMO-TOP component models the on- and off-line oceanic tracers transport and the biogeochemical properties using the PISCES model [7]. The model can also be coupled with a variety of other existing models (like the WRF model) to simulate environmental coupling of the ocean and other environments (like the atmosphere).\n",
    "\n",
    "The NEMO-OCE component is the base component of the model and is the component of NEMO that will be focused on for the purpose of this numerical experiment. It solves a number of different equations but is based on the momentum balance and heat and salt conservation equations. The NEMO-OCE component also models advection and diffusion of a number of different tracers and implements some of the same solution schemes that we covered in class, such as a centered advection scheme and a QUICKEST scheme. The state equations for the NEMO-OCE component include the Equation of Seawater (EOS), the Brunt-Vaisala frequency, and the freezing point of seawater [6]. \n",

    "The NEMO model is capable of being used in almost limitless applications where the ocean is involved in even a small way and can be coupled with numerous other earth and environmental models to simulate just about any situation you could imagine. In previous studies the NEMO model has been used to study everything from changes in sea ice to changes in ocean salinity to the effects of climate change on marine biomass. Several studies have also used the NEMO model to study ocean tides and how the effect other earth systems and processes. In a recent study, the NEMO model was used to analyze the impact of ocean-wave coupling on the circulation in the upper layers of the ocean, specifically during storm events [1]. Another study published in 2020 looked at how the ocean tides influence thermohaline properties and circulation patterns in the Bay of Biscay [2]. Studying the effect of the ocean tides can have many applications and coupling with an atmosphere model to study how wind forces influence ocean tides can be a valuable tool in identifying the best locations for tidal energy generation.\n",
    "\n",

    "## III. Data Needs\n",
    "\n",
    "The NEMO model can take a wide range of input data due to the highly customizable nature of the model setup. There is also often a large volume of input data required to run the NEMO model due to the complexity of the physical situations it models. In order to streamline the data input process NEMO has an interface for input data using XIOS software so that data can be imported as an .xml files or net CDF files. The NEMO model also has a separate, 3-module interface for observational data. The OBS module acts as the observation operator, the ASM module is used for application of increments and model bias correction, and the third module is TAM, which was a tangent linear and adjoint model but is only available in release 3.4 of NEMO. As an added component to handle the extensive variability of the input data required for the NEMO model, the NEMO framework utilizes OASIS software to handle coupling of different earth systems. The OASIS coupler allows cross-component communication. The output data generated by the model is equally as customizable, and of similar volume, as the required input and is run by the same data interface that uses the XIOS software [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "Because most of the data input is handled by the interfaces described above, there are really only a few things the user needs to define when starting the model [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "__User Required Inputs:__\n",
    "\n",
    "- A structure in the namelist file to define the input data file and the variable names\n",
    "- The frequency of the data\n",
    "- Whether or not the data is climatological\n",
    "- The period covered by the input file\n",
    "- And, if on the fly interpolation is used, three additional parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned, there are many ways to input data and because the model is so flexible and can couple with so many other models there are also many locations to find the required observational data. However, one suggested source of observational data is the Met Office Hadley Centre observations datasets [4]. This source provides data sets for marine data, pressure data, extremes indices, land surface data, combined land/marine data, and upper air data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## IV. Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "Data calibration is often needed to improve the accuracy of a model. In order to more accurately model the flow caused by ocean tides coupled with wind forces the Obersvation and Model Comparison (OBS) observational data interface module should be used. This will allow model equivalent data to be calculated and interpolated from observational data to the nearest model timestep which should increase the accuracy of the model (at least for initial conditions)[6].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## V. Numerical Experiment Design\n",
    "\n",
    "A numerical experiment to determine the influence of wind forcing on ocean waves could be designed to determine optimum locations for tidal energy generation facilities. This experiment would model a coupled ocean-atmosphere environment using the NEMO model coupled to the WRF model to predict ocean waves frequency and magnitude and look at the potential increase in ocean flow through specific coastal locations. It is expected that wind forcing would increase ocean wave frequency and magnitude and that locations with consistent winds and relatively strong tides would be good locations for tidal energy generation. To test this theory, the numerical experiment would model the effect of wind forcing on ocean waves in several places that historically have consistent, relatively high winds and also in areas that have inconsistent or low winds. One of the areas modeled could be the Bay of Biscay which would allow this experiment to build on the experiment discussed in _The Impact of Tides on the Bay of Biscay Dynamics_ [2].\n",
