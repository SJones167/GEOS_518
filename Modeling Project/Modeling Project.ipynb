    "\n",
    "With concerns about environmental health and climate change on the rise, developing, improving, and establishing methods of clean energy generation is of increasing importance. One mode of renewable energy that has a lot of room for development is the generation of power through tidal energy. Currently, tidal energy is relatively undeveloped and has yet to be implemented in very many locations. One of the major challenges of tidal energy is identifying locations where it is both feasible and profitable to build the necessary facilities for power production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tidal power generation requires a consistent flow of water in order to function. Finding consistent flows sufficient to justify tidal power generation can be difficult in a highly variable medium such as the ocean where both flow intensity and direction are frequently changing and are affected by so many external forcings. Because the installation of tidal energy infrastructure is so costly and invasive, it is important to identify locations where it will be effective and useful. Models of ocean tides can be a valuable tool to select suitable locations for implementation of this challenging clean energy source. Coupling of ocean models and atmospheric models may also provide valuable insight on the significance of wind forcing on ocean tides and identify areas that would be either more or less suited to tidal energy generation because of it.\n",

    "## II. Model Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The model being profiled is the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) model that is developed by the NEMO Consortium which was established in 2008 and pulls together 5 European institutions (CMCC, CNRS, Mercator, Met-Office, NERC-NOC). The NEMO model is an open source, open access model comprised of three major components called NEMO-OCE, NEMO-SI3, and NEMO-TOP. The NEMO-OCE component models ocean thermodynamics and solves primitive equations; the NEMO-SI3 component models sea-ice thermodynamics, brine inclusions and subgrid-scale thickness variations; the NEMO-TOP component models the on- and off-line oceanic tracers transport and the biogeochemical properties using the PISCES model [1]. The model can also be coupled with a variety of other existing models (like the WRF model) to simulate environmental coupling of the ocean and other environments (like the atmosphere).\n",
    "\n",
    "The NEMO-OCE component is the base component of the model and is the component of NEMO that will be focused on for the purpose of this numerical experiment. It solves a number of different equations but is based on the momentum balance and heat and salt conservation equations. The NEMO-OCE component also models advection and diffusion of a number of different tracers and implements some of the same solution schemes that we covered in class, such as a centered advection scheme and a QUICKEST scheme. The state equations for the NEMO-OCE component include the Equation of Seawater (EOS), the Brunt-Vaisala frequency, and the freezing point of seawater [2]. \n",

    "The NEMO model is capable of being used in almost limitless applications where the ocean is involved in even a small way and can be coupled with numerous other earth and environmental models to simulate just about any situation you could imagine. In previous studies the NEMO model has been used to study everything from changes in sea ice to changes in ocean salinity to the effects of climate change on marine biomass. Several studies have also used the NEMO model to study ocean tides and how the effect other earth systems and processes. In a recent study, the NEMO model was used to analyze the impact of ocean-wave coupling on the circulation in the upper layers of the ocean, specifically during storm events [3]. Another study published in 2020 looked at how the ocean tides influence thermohaline properties and circulation patterns in the Bay of Biscay [8]. Studying the effect of the ocean tides can have many applications and coupling with an atmosphere model to study how wind forces influence ocean tides can be a valuable tool in identifying the best locations for tidal energy generation.\n",
